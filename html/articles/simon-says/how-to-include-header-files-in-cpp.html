    C++ is known for both its versatility and complexity. Part of the reason for its widespread usage is the fact that it
    is like an extension to the C programming language, inheriting much of C's syntax and semantics. That includes
    (non-intentional pun) the C preprocessor and the
    include system. In this article I'm going to talk about how I am including header files when I'm writing C++, what
    conventions I use in order to maximize consistency and to avoid certain issues, and the rules I follow
    when I have to think about dependencies between source and header files. I hope that this will help you write
    better C++.

<h3>An Example Library</h3>

<p>
    Let's start with an example of a C++ library that we might write, that uses a C library as a dependency, and it's
    being used by a C++ executable. We'll see all the code first, then I'll explain why I've written it this way.

    const std::filesystem::path path {"/home/simon/Documents"};
    my_library.take_filesystem_path(path);
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Let's say that we're writing <code>MyLibrary</code>. We don't actually care what it's doing. Instead, we care about what
    it contains and what it depends on as a class and as a C++ library.

    There are two kinds of dependencies in C++, that we are going to talk about: at the code level and at the binary
    level. Dependencies at the code level represent the relationships between the objects in the code, i.e. between
    types. Dependencies at the binary level are the relationships between C++ libraries and executables.
</p>

<h3>Code Level Dependencies</h3>

<p>
    See that <code>MyLibrary</code> makes use of <code>std::size_t</code>, <code>std::optional</code>, <code>std::filesystem::path</code> etc.
    Those are all definitions that the class depends on. We have to include their corresponding header files in order
    to use them. Thus every single one of those includes brings in a dependency for the class. Remember the
    three relationship types between classes: composition, aggregation and association.
    <code>std::string</code> is a composite object, same as <code>std::unique_ptr</code> itself.
    For this matter we must include <code>&lt;string&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;memory&gt;</code>.
    <code>std::optional</code> and <code>std::filesystem::path</code>
    are associates. They are not part of the class, but they are used as function return types and parameters.
    For these too we must include <code>&lt;optional&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;filsystem&gt;</code>.
    Lastly, <code>SomeCLibraryContext</code> is an aggregate, because it's not a member of <code>MyLibrary</code> directly,
    it's a pointer instead. <code>MyLibrary</code> could work just fine with <code>m_some_c_library</code> being <code>nullptr</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Take note that I did not include <code>&lt;some_c_library.h&gt;</code> in the header file for a reason. I instead wrote a
    forward declaration. <code>MyLibrary</code> is in fact very happy just knowing that <code>SomeCLibraryContext</code> exists somewhere,
    without knowing its full definition. I'll talk about the reason for this decision later, but now, looking at
    <code>my_library.cpp</code>, we finally include <code>&lt;some_c_library.h&gt;</code>, because here, in the
    implementation of <code>MyLibrary</code>, we do need the definition of <code>SomeCLibraryContext</code> and need to call its functions.
</p>

<h3>Binary Level Dependencies</h3>

    ├── some_c_library.c
    └── some_c_library.h
</code></pre>

<pre class="code-block-header">CMakeLists.txt</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)

project("how_to_include_in_cpp")

add_library(some_c_library STATIC "some_c_library/some_c_library.c" "some_c_library/some_c_library.h")

target_include_directories(my_library PUBLIC "my_library")
target_link_libraries(my_library PRIVATE some_c_library)

add_executable(main "main.cpp")
target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE my_library)
</code></pre>

<p>
    When I say binaries, I'm of course referring to executables and libraries. Libraries in C and C++ usually come
    with a compiled binary blob and a header file. Anywhere we include that header file, we bring in that
    library as a dependency (assuming we also link the library).
    Any time we include <code>&lt;string&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code>, we bring in <code>libstdc++</code>,
    the standard library as a dependency. Including <code>&lt;some_c_library.h&gt;</code> in the source file of
    <code>MyLibrary</code> means that <code>libmy_library</code> alone depends on <code>libsome_c_library</code>.
    If we instead included <code>&lt;some_c_library.h&gt;</code> in the header file, then we just made
    <code>libsome_c_library</code> a dependency not only on <code>libmy_library</code>, but also on all of its dependents
    (all libraries and executables that depend on <code>libmy_library</code>). That is because including a header
    that includes other headers and other headers recursively ends up including everything. I avoided including the
    header library <code>&lt;some_c_library.h&gt;</code> in the header file to keep <code>libsome_c_library</code>
    like an implementation to main.
</p>

<p>
    If we didn't care for that side effect, then we could have made <code>SomeCLibraryContext</code> a composite,
    which would have saved us a heap allocation, but then we had to also mark target <code>some_c_library</code>
    accessible from target <code>main</code>:
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code># ...

add_library(my_library STATIC "my_library/my_library.cpp" "my_library/my_library.hpp")
target_include_directories(my_library PUBLIC "my_library")
target_link_libraries(my_library PUBLIC some_c_library)  # Note the `PUBLIC` here

# ...
</code></pre>

<h3>Friends Aren't Hard Dependencies</h3>

<p>
    If in a header file containing a class, we need a specific object name just to mark it as a friend, then we
    don't need its full definition:
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">class_a.hpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>#pragma once

// Don't need to include class_b.hpp
class B;

class A {
    friend class B;
};
</code></pre>

<pre class="code-block-header">class_b.hpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>#pragma once

class B {};
</code></pre>

<h3>To Include Or Not To Include</h3>

<p>
    See that <code>main.cpp</code> only ever includes <code>&lt;my_library.hpp&gt;</code>. That is because it only needs
    <code>&lt;my_library.hpp&gt;</code>! Even though we use <code>std::optional</code> and <code>std::filesystem::path</code>
    in <code>main()</code>, we don't have to include <code>&lt;optional&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;filesystem&gt;</code>,
    because those are already included im <code>&lt;my_library.hpp&gt;</code>. A rule of thumb is that if we only use
    <code>std::optional</code> and <code>std::filesystem::path</code> in the context of <code>&lt;my_library.hpp&gt;</code>,
    then we don't include the headers again, but if we use them independent of <code>&lt;my_library.hpp&gt;</code>,
    then we should include those headers, because if at any point in the future we get rid of <code>&lt;my_library.hpp&gt;</code>,
    we'll suddenly have compilation errors with undefined symbols.
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">main.cpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;

    }

    DataFile data {"whatever.txt"};

<p>
    We have to be careful what headers we include in other headers, for example in your library's headers.
    Users of your library may not be happy having tons of symbols accessible within their code because of
    your messy library header. Avoid including <code>&lt;cassert&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code> in header files.
</p>

<p>
    What do I hear? You need to overload the &lt;&lt; operator in order to print stuff? For that you may consider including
    <code>&lt;iosfwd&gt;</code> instead:
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">thing.hpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>#pragma once

#include &lt;iosfwd&gt;  // Don't include iostream here

struct Thing {
    int x {};
};

template&lt;typename CharType, typename Traits&gt;
std::basic_ostream&lt;CharType, Traits&gt;& operator&lt;&lt;(std::basic_ostream&lt;CharType, Traits&gt;& stream, const Thing& thing) {
    stream &lt;&lt; "Thing { " &lt;&lt; thing.x &lt;&lt; " }";
    return stream;
}
</code></pre>

<pre class="code-block-header">main.cpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

#include "thing.hpp"

int main() {
    Thing thing;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; thing &lt;&lt; "\n";  // Printing works, because we included iostream, as we should
}
</code></pre>

<pre class="cmd"><code>g++ -o main main.cpp</code></pre>

<p>
    Here, we are making <code>Thing</code> printable to any sort of output stream. Because the function is a template, we can actually
    get away with writing its definition in the header, even though <code>std::basic_ostream&lt;...&gt;</code> is just a forward declaration.
    The header on its own compiles just fine. The moment we actually call <code>operator&lt;&lt;</code> on a <code>Thing</code> object we actually
    need <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code> to be included. It just works!
</p>

<h3>Source/Header Pairs</h3>

<p>
    Taking again a look at <code>my_library.cpp</code>, we see that the first line is <code>#include "my_library.hpp"</code>.
    A rule of thumb here is when we have a pair of files <code>something.hpp</code>/<code>something.cpp</code>, the first line in
    <code>something.cpp</code> should always be an include of its header. That is because the header should be a
    self-contained section of the code and being pasted at the top of the source file ensures that we do make it self-contained.
    Take a look at this broken code now:
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">broken.hpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>#pragma once

struct Broken {
    void do_thing(std::string_view parameter);
};
</code></pre>

<pre class="code-block-header">broken.cpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>#include &lt;string_view&gt;

#include "broken.hpp"

void Broken::do_thing(std::string_view parameter) {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<pre class="code-block-header">broken_main.cpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>#include &lt;string_view&gt;

#include "broken.hpp"

int main() {
    Broken broken;
    const std::string_view str {"???"};
    broken.do_thing(str);
}
</code></pre>

<pre class="cmd"><code>g++ -o broken_main broken_main.cpp broken.cpp</code></pre>

<p>
    This code compiles just fine. But can you see the problem? broken.hpp is not self-contained. We include <code>"broken.hpp"</code>
    in <code>broken.cpp</code> after we include <code>&lt;string_view&gt;</code>, that shouldn't be there in the first place.
    And in <code>broken_main.cpp</code> we again somehow include <code>&lt;string_view&gt;</code> and the whole thing works,
    but it's messed up. Don't do that.
</p>

<h3>Angle Brackets Versus Quotes</h3>

<p>
    In the last example, we included <code>"broken.hpp"</code> with quotes. That is because it's not a separate library.
    Library headers should be included with angle brackets and local headers in the current project should
    be included with quotes. The only difference between the two is that including with angle brackets searches
    the header only in system library directories and additional include directories, while including with quotes
    searches the header also in the current working directory of the file we are including into.
</p>

<h3>Order Of Inclusion</h3>

<p>
    To keep the includes nicely organized, I like to have them in a specific order. That is:
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>#include "something.hpp"  // The source's header

#include &lt;iostream&gt;  // Standard library headers
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;cassert&gt;

#include &lt;some_library.hpp&gt;  // Other library headers
#include &lt;third_party_library.hpp&gt;

#include "some_class_related_to_something"  // Project headers
#include "some_definitions_related_to_something"
</code></pre>

<p>
    Pay close attention when we use quotes and when we use angle brackets.
</p>

<p>
    Some people like to swap the standard library headers with project headers. I personally don't like that, but it's up
    to you. Also some people order those header groups alphabetically or in some other fashion. I don't mind it
    that much, but it's fine.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
    The takeaway from this article is to be cautious about which headers you are including and whether you actually
    need to include them or not, especially in other header files. Use standard best practices like the ones presented
    earlier. And when refactoring C++ code, when shuffling code around... I wish you luck! Be careful not to end up
    with unnecessary, wrong or missing includes. That is indeed one of the hardest parts of C and C++.
</p>

    I hope that you found this article useful!
