<p>
    Object-oriented programming has been and still is a very popular programming language paradigm. I bet that you
    heard of it, if you studied programming for any length of time. It's popular for a good reason: It allows the
    programmer to more easily reason about the entities and concepts they try to model, to materialize into code.
    Put more simply, object-oriented programming, in contrast to pure procedural or functional paradigms, is mostly
    just a different way to organize the code, which consists of logic and data. However, there are some caveats
    to that, of course. Here is quick a reminder that we are talking about C++. Yay! What I mean is that using
    inheritance and virtual functions to solve everything is not always a good idea.
</p>

<p>
    This article presents a problem that could have many solutions, tries to solve it with what could be called
    "the obvious solution" in an object-oriented language, explains why that may not be such a good idea in C++ and
    finally proposes a new solution, a different approach. Let's jump right in!
</p>

<h3>The Problem that We Are Trying to Solve</h3>

<p>
    As programmers, our job is to solve problems. That's a fancy way of saying that we write code that accomplishes
    something that for most normal people doesn't make any sense. But it does for us.
</p>

<p>
    Our problem is this: We have a pretty complex graphical application that has a main infinite loop with two types
    of business logic code:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Code executing every iteration of the loop and</li>
    <li>Code executing when certain events occur, like when a key is pressed, a mouse is moved, or a window is resized.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Because that is not complex enough, we need yet another way of executing code: tasks and asynchronous tasks. In our
    case, tasks are pieces of code that are run either at a certain point in time, at a certain part of the main loop,
    or completely independently of the rest of the code, basically as threads. You'll understand better what I mean
    by that shortly.
</p>

<p>
    Let's start with a rough API that we would like to have, in pseudocode:
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>class TaskObject {
    TaskObject(Function function);

    Function function;
}

class TaskManager {
    void add_task(TaskObject task);  // Add a task to be executed at some point in time
    void update();  // Execute current pending tasks
    void clear();  // Discard current pending tasks

    // Some container for storing pending tasks
}

// Over to application

class Application {
    void main_loop() {
        while (true) {
            // Update events
            // Update graphics
            // Business logic

            task_manager.update();
        }
    }

    TaskManager task_manager;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is a partial outline of our solution to the problem. In our main application class, we store a task manager,
    which in turn takes care of storing data related to tasks and executing them at the right time. We also have
    the option to discard any current pending tasks. To fire a task some time in the future, we call the <code>add_task</code> method.
    Tasks, for now, are objects that store the callback function.
</p>

<p>
    So far, so good. But what I did not specify yet is that we need a few different kinds of tasks, each that run
    in a different way. Does that sound to you like inheritance and virtual functions?
</p>

<p>
    I already mentioned the asynchronous tasks, which do not run with the main loop, but in
    a different thread. That means that we need to handle asynchronous tasks very differently from the other.
    The other tasks are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Immediate: tasks that run once at the very next call of <code>update</code>;</li>
    <li>Repeatable: tasks that run indefinitely once every few seconds, or at an interval;</li>
    <li>Delayed: tasks that run once after a certain amount of seconds, or with a delay;</li>
    <li>Deferred: tasks that run once, skipping only one call of <code>update</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    All of these tasks need to be fired from any thread, in order to facilitate the use of the asynchronous ones.
    That problem is easily solved with a simple mutex, but for brevity we will not talk about that any further.
</p>

<p>
    This problem of tasks can be solved in an object-oriented fashion: We could have a base task class with a virtual
    function <code>update</code> and with data common to all tasks, i.e. the callback function. Every type of task could then
    derive from the base class and add their own data needed for their own overriden <code>update</code> method. The task manager
    then could iterate over all tasks, calling their <code>update</code> method, which in turn calls their callback functions at the
    right time. Sounds good? Let's see...
</p>

<h3>The Inheritance-Based Approach</h3>

<p>
    We'll start off with the base task class:
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.hpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>#pragma once

#include &lt;functional>

using TaskFunction = std::function&lt;void()>;

class Task {
public:
    explicit Task(TaskFunction&& task_function)
        : m_task_function(std::move(task_function)) {}
    virtual ~Task() = default;

    virtual bool update() = 0;
protected:
    TaskFunction m_task_function;
};
</code></pre>

<p>
    It contains the callback as a protected member, accessible from derived classes, as all of them essentially
    call a specific user function. It also has a pure virtual <code>update</code> function, that returns true when the task has
    completed and can be discarded, and false otherwise. Don't forget about the virtual destructor, even if
    the derived classes probably won't have custom destructors.
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.hpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>class Task {
public:
    explicit Task(TaskFunction&& task_function)
        : m_task_function(std::move(task_function)) {}
    virtual ~Task() = default;

    virtual bool update() = 0;
protected:
    TaskFunction m_task_function;
};

struct ImmediateTask : Task {
    explicit ImmediateTask(TaskFunction&& task_function)
        : Task(std::move(task_function)) {}

    bool update() override;
};

class RepeatableTask : public Task {
public:
    RepeatableTask(TaskFunction&& task_function, double interval)
        : Task(std::move(task_function)), m_interval(interval) {}

    bool update() override;
private:
    double m_interval {};
    double m_last_time {};
    double m_total_time {};
};

class DelayedTask : public Task {
public:
    DelayedTask(TaskFunction&& task_function, double delay)
        : Task(std::move(task_function)), m_delay(delay) {}

    bool update() override;
private:
    double m_delay {};
    double m_last_time {};
    double m_total_time {};
};

class DeferredTask : public Task {
public:
    explicit DeferredTask(TaskFunction&& task_function)
        : Task(std::move(task_function)) {}

    bool update() override;
private:
    bool m_deferred {};
};
</code></pre>

<p>
    Then, each type of task is implemented in its own class. Each one overrides the <code>update</code> method, which will
    be called continously every iteration of the application loop. This method decides when the callback function
    is actually called and when the task is done or not. Quite a lot of boilerplate code too.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, here is the actual implementation of the previous functions:
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.cpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>#include "task.hpp"

double get_time();

bool ImmediateTask::update() {
    m_task_function();

    return true;
}

bool RepeatableTask::update() {
    const double current_time {get_time()};
    const double elapsed_time {current_time - m_last_time};

    m_last_time = current_time;
    m_total_time += elapsed_time;

    if (m_total_time &gt; m_interval) {
        m_total_time = 0.0;
        m_task_function();
    }

    return false;
}

bool DelayedTask::update() {
    const double current_time {get_time()};
    const double elapsed_time {current_time - m_last_time};

    m_last_time = current_time;
    m_total_time += elapsed_time;

    if (m_total_time &gt; m_delay) {
        m_task_function();
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}

bool DeferredTask::update() {
    if (m_deferred) {
        m_task_function();
        return true;
    }

    m_deferred = true;
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    The logic behind the tasks is not very relevant to the subject of the article, but to make sure we understand
    how we are doing what we are doing, I included that code. <code>get_time</code> is a function that returns the current
    system time in seconds.
</p>

<p>
    It looks like we are making good progress. But right here we hit a problem. The asynchronous tasks cannot
    be modeled after the base <code>Task</code> class that we made earlier. This type of tasks works in a fundamentally
    different way. Asynchronous tasks run independently from other code, in a separate thread and need to
    communicate back to the main thread when they are done or when they encounter an exception. We can try
    at least:
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.hpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>#include &lt;thread&gt;
#include &lt;exception&gt;

class AsyncTask : public Task {
public:
    explicit AsyncTask(TaskFunction&& task_function)
        : Task(std::move(task_function)), m_thread(std::move(task_function)) {}

    bool update() override;

    void finish();
    void finish(std::exception_ptr exception);
private:
    std::exception_ptr m_exception;
    std::jthread m_thread;
};
</code></pre>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.cpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>void AsyncTask::finish() {
    m_thread.request_stop();
}

void AsyncTask::finish(std::exception_ptr exception) {
    m_exception = exception;
    m_thread.request_stop();
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    The asynchronous task needs to store a handle to a thread, that is in our case an object of type <code>jthread</code> from C++20.
    It also stores a pointer to a generic exception, for the main thread to handle the errors that the task itself
    couldn't handle alone. But remember how inheritance works? Yes, we also inherit a completely useless function
    object from the base <code>Task</code> class. And there's something else too: We cannot use the <code>TaskFunction</code> defined
    previously, because it accepts no arguments. Our <code>AsyncTask</code> needs to execute a function that accepts
    a reference to itself, for the task thread to signal the main thread when it is done. So we need to define
    another function type:
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.hpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>class AsyncTask;

using AsyncTaskFunction = std::function&lt;void(AsyncTask&)&gt;;

class AsyncTask : public Task {
public:
    explicit AsyncTask(AsyncTaskFunction&& task_function)
        : Task({}), m_thread(std::move(task_function), std::ref(*this)) {}

    bool update() override;

    void finish();
    void finish(std::exception_ptr exception);
private:
    std::exception_ptr m_exception;
    std::jthread m_thread;
};
</code></pre>

<p>
    I don't like where this is going. It looks like <code>AsyncTask</code> needs to be its own class, separate from the other classes.
    If you agree with me, then let's skip asynchronous tasks for now and switch our focus to the task manager. If you
    don't agree, well, you'll see soon...
</p>

<p>
    Here is our task manager class:
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.hpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;

class TaskManager {
public:
    void add_task(Task&& task);
    void update();
    void clear();
private:
    std::vector&lt;Task&gt; m_incoming_tasks;
    std::vector&lt;Task&gt; m_active_tasks;
};
</code></pre>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.cpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>void TaskManager::add_task(Task&& task) {
    m_incoming_tasks.push_back(std::move(task));
}

void TaskManager::update() {
    for (auto& task : m_active_tasks) {
        if (task-&gt;update()) {
            m_incoming_tasks.push_back(std::move(task));
        }
    }

    m_active_tasks.clear();
    std::swap(m_incoming_tasks, m_active_tasks);
}

void TaskManager::clear() {
    m_incoming_tasks.clear();
    m_active_tasks.clear();
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is where we hit yet another problem. In order to be able to fire different kinds of tasks, we need to store
    an array of references or pointers to their base class. Storing objects of <code>Task</code> can't help us, because the moment
    that we try to push a derived task to the array of base task, we simply slice off the derived object. It wouldn't
    work anyway, because the <code>update</code> method from <code>Task</code> is pure virtual. We cannot instantiate objects of <code>Task</code>.
    We can only refer to derived objects through <code>Task</code>.
</p>

<p>
    All of this means that we either need to allocate tasks somewhere else on the stack and push pointers to them,
    or to allocate them on the heap. Yikes!
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.hpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>class TaskManager {
public:
    void add_task(std::unique_ptr&lt;Task&gt;&& task);
    void update();
    void clear();
private:
    std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;Task&gt;&gt; m_incoming_tasks;
    std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;Task&gt;&gt; m_active_tasks;
};
</code></pre>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.cpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>void TaskManager::add_task(std::unique_ptr&lt;Task&gt;&& task) {
    m_incoming_tasks.push_back(std::move(task));
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This works, but I'm already feeling a bit uneasy. Allocating objects on the heap with <code>new</code> is generally a very
    heavy operation and we should strive to avoid it. We expect the tasks to be lightweight objects, easy and quick
    to create and destroy. We want to be able to process hundreds of tasks without dragging the whole program down.
</p>

<p>
    Now we should realize the problem with using virtual functions, a technique called dynamic dispatch, through inheritance
    in C++. The use of virtual functions encourages heap allocation, which often is not necessary, especially in
    this case. If you are coming from managed object-oriented languages like Java, you're probably wondering what's
    up with all this fuss. For you, the previous solution might be the obvious choice in Java. Well, there is
    a big difference between the two here: Allocating objects in Java (or C#, Python, JavaScript) is not the same
    as allocating objects in C++. In Java, every object is allocated on the heap. Java utilizes a very special
    allocator adapted for the objects in its virtual machine, that has several layers of complexity built on top
    of the system allocator, which is <code>malloc</code>. Creating objects in Java is pretty fast.
    C++, on the other hand, allocates every object directly with the system allocator, which is not well fit for
    many small allocations. Yes, you can override the global allocator or
    override the <code>new</code> operator for specific objects, but that is not easy in practice and you'll still be better
    off avoiding <code>new</code> altogether and allocating on the stack or in-place.
</p>

<p class="text-red">
    Allocating objects with <code>new</code> is generally slow.
</p>

<h3>A Different Approach, Avoiding Heap Allocations</h3>

<p>
    Instead of using inheritance to program different types of tasks, we could simply use just one class to represent
    all of them! Let's see how we are going to do it.
</p>

<p>
    We define an enumeration with a variant for every type of non-asynchronous task:
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.hpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>enum class TaskType {
    Immediate,
    Repeatable,
    Delayed,
    Deferred
};
</code></pre>

<p>
    We will represent asynchronous tasks using a different class, but first here is the class for all the other tasks:
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.hpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>#include &lt;functional&gt;

class TaskManager;

using TaskFunction = std::function&lt;void()&gt;;

class Task {
public:
    Task(TaskFunction&& task_function, TaskType type);
private:
    union {
        struct {
            double interval;
            double last_time;
            double total_time;
        } m_repeatable;

        struct {
            double delay;
            double last_time;
            double total_time;
        } m_delayed;

        struct {
            bool deferred;
        } m_deferred;
    };

    TaskFunction m_task_function;
    TaskType m_type {};

    friend class TaskManager;
};
</code></pre>

<p>
    Yes, unions are the solution to our problem. The enumeration defined previously tells us which type of task an
    instance represents. We pass the callback function and, most importantly, the task type into the constructor,
    which takes care of fully initializing all the members, including the union:
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.cpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>#include "task.hpp"

double get_time();

Task::Task(TaskFunction&& task_function, TaskType type)
    : m_task_function(std::move(task_function)), m_type(type) {
    switch (type) {
        case TaskType::Immediate:
            break;
        case TaskType::Repeatable:
            m_repeatable.interval = 0.0;
            m_repeatable.last_time = get_time();
            m_repeatable.total_time = 0.0;
            break;
        case TaskType::Delayed:
            m_delayed.delay = 0.0;
            m_delayed.last_time = get_time();
            m_delayed.total_time = 0.0;
            break;
        case TaskType::Deferred:
            m_deferred.deferred = false;
            break;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    We also declare the task manager to be a friend, since it is now his job to update the tasks. Thus it needs
    access to their data.
</p>

<p>
    The asynchronous task class, <code>AsyncTask</code>, no longer inherits from <code>Task</code> and it also declares <code>TaskManager</code> to be a friend.
    We will soon finish its implementation.
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.hpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>#include &lt;thread&gt;
#include &lt;exception&gt;

class AsyncTask;

using AsyncTaskFunction = std::function&lt;void(AsyncTask&)&gt;;

class AsyncTask {
public:
    AsyncTask(AsyncTaskFunction&& task_function)
        : m_thread(std::move(task_function), std::ref(*this)) {}

    void finish();
    void finish(std::exception_ptr exception);
private:
    std::exception_ptr m_exception;
    std::jthread m_thread;

    friend class TaskManager;
};
</code></pre>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.cpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>void AsyncTask::finish() {
    m_thread.request_stop();
}

void AsyncTask::finish(std::exception_ptr exception) {
    m_exception = exception;
    m_thread.request_stop();
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    The task manager now looks different:
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.hpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>#include &lt;vector&gt;

class TaskManager {
public:
    void add_immediate_task(TaskFunction&& task_function);
    void add_repeatable_task(TaskFunction&& task_function, double interval);
    void add_delayed_task(TaskFunction&& task_function, double delay);
    void add_deferred_task(TaskFunction&& task_function);

    void update();
    void clear();
private:
    void update_tasks();

    bool update_immediate_task(Task& task);
    bool update_repeatable_task(Task& task);
    bool update_delayed_task(Task& task);
    bool update_deferred_task(Task& task);

    std::vector&lt;Task&gt; m_incoming_tasks;
    std::vector&lt;Task&gt; m_active_tasks;
};
</code></pre>

<p>
    We use a different <code>add_*</code> function for each type of task. We also need a function to handle each type of task
    based on its type.
</p>

<p>
    Let's jump in right where we had trouble last time, over to the implementations of <code>add_*</code> functions:
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.cpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>#include &lt;cassert&gt;

void TaskManager::add_immediate_task(TaskFunction&& task_function) {
    m_incoming_tasks.emplace_back(std::move(task_function), TaskType::Immediate);
}

void TaskManager::add_repeatable_task(TaskFunction&& task_function, double interval) {
    assert(interval &gt; 0.0);

    Task& task {m_incoming_tasks.emplace_back(std::move(task_function), TaskType::Repeatable)};
    task.m_repeatable.interval = interval;
}

void TaskManager::add_delayed_task(TaskFunction&& task_function, double delay) {
    assert(delay &gt; 0.0);

    Task& task {m_incoming_tasks.emplace_back(std::move(task_function), TaskType::Delayed)};
    task.m_delayed.delay = delay;
}

void TaskManager::add_deferred_task(TaskFunction&& task_function) {
    m_incoming_tasks.emplace_back(std::move(task_function), TaskType::Deferred);
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    We construct the objects in place in order to avoid needlessly allocating them on the stack and then copying
    them in the right place. Under the hood, the <code>placement new</code> operator is used to achieve this functionality.
    Look at that! We got rid of dynamic allocation. We don't need to call any virtual function on a reference or pointer.
    The rest should be self explanatory.
</p>

<p>
    Updating the tasks is pretty much the same, just that it's done by the task manager himself:
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.cpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>void TaskManager::update() {
    update_tasks();
}

void TaskManager::update_tasks() {
    for (Task& task : m_active_tasks) {
        bool(TaskManager::*update_function)(Task&) {};

        switch (task.m_type) {
            case TaskType::Immediate:
                update_function = &TaskManager::update_immediate_task;
                break;
            case TaskType::Repeatable:
                update_function = &TaskManager::update_repeatable_task;
                break;
            case TaskType::Delayed:
                update_function = &TaskManager::update_delayed_task;
                break;
            case TaskType::Deferred:
                update_function = &TaskManager::update_deferred_task;
                break;
        }

        if (!(*this.*update_function)(task)) {
            m_incoming_tasks.push_back(task);
        }
    }

    m_active_tasks.clear();
    std::swap(m_incoming_tasks, m_active_tasks);
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    We loop over all the active tasks just as before, check their type, and finally call the corresponding
    <code>update_*</code> method on them. The syntax for function pointer variables is indeed alien, just don't mind it.
    Look up examples from the documentation when you need to write something like this.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, updating each task type is exactly the same. I wonder why do I bother showing you the code again:
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.cpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>bool TaskManager::update_immediate_task(Task& task) {
    task.m_task_function();

    return true;
}

bool TaskManager::update_repeatable_task(Task& task) {
    const double current_time {get_time()};
    const double elapsed_time {current_time - task.m_repeatable.last_time};

    task.m_repeatable.last_time = current_time;

    And we are done with four out of the five tasks. The only difference between this approach and the previous
    one is that we no longer have to allocate each task on the heap. Now, task construction and destruction
    is incredibly cheap compared to last time. The cost of calling a virtual function is exactly the same
    as the cost of calling a different method based on a tag, the enumeration. The advantage is not needing
    dynamic allocation or some sort of reference or pointer.

    Let's finish the asynchronous tasks:
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.hpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>#include &lt;forward_list&gt;

class TaskManager {
public:
    void add_immediate_task(TaskFunction&& task_function);
    void add_repeatable_task(TaskFunction&& task_function, double interval);
    void add_delayed_task(TaskFunction&& task_function, double delay);
    void add_deferred_task(TaskFunction&& task_function);
    void add_async_task(AsyncTaskFunction&& task_function);  // &lt;--

    void update();
    void clear();
private:
    void update_tasks();
    void update_async_tasks();  // &lt;--

    bool update_immediate_task(Task& task);
    bool update_repeatable_task(Task& task);
    bool update_delayed_task(Task& task);
    bool update_deferred_task(Task& task);

    std::vector&lt;Task&gt; m_incoming_tasks;
    std::vector&lt;Task&gt; m_active_tasks;
    std::forward_list&lt;AsyncTask&gt; m_async_tasks;  // &lt;--
};
</code></pre>

<p>
    We use a singly linked list for asynchronous tasks, because we know in advance that they will be used
    more sparingly. We don't expect ever to be more than two or three asynchronous tasks at once. If you need a lot
    of threads, then you might want to look into thread pools. A nice property of the linked list is that
    removing elements while iterating over the list is very easy to achieve:
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.cpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>void TaskManager::update_async_tasks() {
    std::exception_ptr last_exception;

    for (auto before_iter {m_async_tasks.before_begin()}, iter {m_async_tasks.begin()}; iter != m_async_tasks.end();) {
        const auto& task {*iter};

        if (task.m_thread.get_stop_token().stop_requested()) {
            if (task.m_exception) {
                last_exception = task.m_exception;
            }

            iter = m_async_tasks.erase_after(before_iter);

            continue;
        }

        before_iter++, iter++;
    }

    if (last_exception) {
        std::rethrow_exception(last_exception);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    The only reason to iterate over the asynchronous tasks is to check for their completion in order to join their threads.
    We require the asynchronous tasks to never throw and to always call the finish method upon exiting. We then
    check if the task finished with an exception or not and if so, then we throw that exception, whatever it is,
    in order to let the main thread handle the error. This is one correct way to handle errors in threads.
    One small caveat is that if multiple asynchronous tasks finish with an exception at the same time, then only
    the last exception gets a chance to be handled, which, depending on the application, might be just fine.
</p>

<p class="text-red">
    Linked lists are often considered a niche in application programming. Use them only when their benefits outweight
    their costs.
</p>

<p>
    Let's not forget about the rest of the code:
</p>

<pre class="code-block-header">task.cpp</pre>
<pre class="code-block"><code>void TaskManager::add_async_task(AsyncTaskFunction&& task_function) {
    m_async_tasks.emplace_front(std::move(task_function));
}

void TaskManager::update() {
    update_tasks();
    update_async_tasks();
}

void TaskManager::clear() {
    m_async_tasks.clear();
    m_incoming_tasks.clear();
    m_active_tasks.clear();
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Now we are done for real. We can compile all this code with GCC and see that it works:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><code>g++ -c task.cpp -std=c++20</code></pre>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
    The inheritance plus dynamic dispatch feature in C++ has its use. I know that it is the de facto option
    in languages like Java or C#, but C++ is different. In C++ you have to worry about memory. That is the reason
    why you are writing C++ in the first place! I'm not saying to never use virtual functions or to never allocate
    objects on the heap, but to really think if using these features makes sense and is optimal. I actually
    did use virtual functions and inheritance a lot in the same project from which I derived the problem in
    this article. I like using virtual functions when they make sense. And inheritance has a lot of uses in C++
    outside of "class Car extends class Vehicle".
