<p>
    C++, among its dozens of keywords, has a funny little keyword inherited from C named <code>const</code>. It is short for constant
    and it is a qualifier that tells the compiler that some value does not change. <code>const</code> as a concept exists only for
    the compiler and for us writing the code. There is no such thing as a <code>const</code> variable in the machine code, that
    the compiler generates. <code>const</code> is a tool for the programmer to help keep the code correct and manageable. That is why,
    in this article, I would like to present to you, in order:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>when <code>const</code> should always be used (and a similar keyword to use instead!),</li>
    <li>when it is beneficial to use,</li>
    <li>when using it is possible, but counter-productive,</li>
    <li>when it might be a bad idea to use and, finally,</li>
    <li>when to never use <code>const</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Actual Constants</h3>

<p>
    Often, we find ourselves writing a piece of logic that contains some magic numbers. Let's say we're writing an update
    function, called repeatedly, for an object that needs to smoothly bob up and down. We would write something like
    this:
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>void update_position() {
    position.y += sin(elapsed_time * 2.0) * 12.0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    But we don't like magic numbers, so we go ahead and put them into variables. Here, we should not even think about
    using <code>const</code>, because we should automatically use it without thinking!
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>void update_position() {
    const double SPEED {2.0};
    const double HEIGHT {12.0};
    position.y += sin(elapsed_time * SPEED) * HEIGHT;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    That looks much better. It is clearer now what those numbers mean and it might tell us that the numbers are chosen
    arbitrarily and that they are configurable. It is much safer now to modify the movement of the object.
</p>

<p>
    There is no point in not making actual constants <code>const</code> and not writing them in a special case, that is
    <code>SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE</code>.
</p>

<h3>Pointers and References</h3>

<p>
    Another place we should definitely use <code>const</code> is with pointers and references. <code>const</code>, here, actually has a slightly
    different meaning, because it tells us and the compiler that we can't modify the referent through that reference, but
    the actual value, the referent, could in fact be mutable. Most often we use references as function parameters,
    in order to pass values to functions as arguments. Often, we need to modify those objects, to read and write to them,
    so we use a mutable reference:
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>struct Vec2 {
    double x, y;
};

struct Object {
    Vec2 position {};
};

void reset_position(Object& object) {
    object.position = {};
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Other times, however, we only need to read an object, thus we use <code>const</code>!
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>double get_position_view_space(const Object& object) {
    return object.position - camera_position;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    <code>const</code> is like a contract that promises that an object will not be modified when passed to a function, for example.
    When I see this:
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>void do_something_with_data(void* data);
</code></pre>

<p>
    Without reading the function body, I immediately know that whatever I pass to data, it might get modified. If, however,
    the parameter were <code>const</code> instead, then I could stay in peace that my data is not going to be modified. It is like
    a promise.
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>void do_something_with_data(const void* data);
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is incredibly important for good APIs. <code>const</code> for references is not just aesthetics, if the intent is to not
    modify the value! We might still find old C APIs that do not respect const correctness. We might need to pass
    a constant value to a function that does not modify the value, but it incorrectly receives it as a mutable reference:
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>typedef struct {
    int x;
    float y;
} Object;

int read_object(Object* object) {
    return object->x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    In this case, in our C++ code, we'd have to use <code>const_cast</code> in order to remove the <code>const</code> qualifier from the pointer:
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>int main() {
    const Object obj {5, 3.14159f};

    // read_object(&obj);  Doesn't work

    read_object(const_cast&lt;Object*&gt;(&obj));
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    But we'd have to be very sure that the function really doesn't modify the value, otherwise it would be undefined
    behavior.
</p>

<p class="text-green">
    We can use <code>const_cast</code> to remove <code>const</code> from references and pointers in any way as long as we don't actually
    try to modify any constant referent object.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, marking reference parameters as <code>const</code> allows us to pass temporary values to those functions:
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>void print_hello(const std::string& name) {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; "!\n";
}

int main() {
    print_hello("Simon");  // Only allowed because name is a constant reference
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Member Functions</h3>

<p>
    Member functions, also known as methods, can be marked as <code>const</code>. In that case, all it does is in fact to const-qualify
    the <code>this</code> pointer:
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>struct Object {
    void non_const_function(int, float);
    void const_function(int, float) const;
};

// Same as if:

struct Object {
    void non_const_function(Object* this, int, float);
    void const_function(const Object* this, int, float);
};
</code></pre>

<p>
    So, we should mark member functions that do not modify the instance as <code>const</code>!
</p>

<h3>Local Variables</h3>

<p>
    Const-qualifying local variables is not as important as in the other cases previously presented, because they do not
    form an API as functions do. They are usually short-lived and contained into small functions or scopes:
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>std::string get_name();
Object create_object(const std::string& description);

int main() {
    // Long line of code
    const std::string obj_description {"Object(" + get_name() + ") is a class used to do this thing and..."};

    const Object obj {create_object(obj_name)};
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    I personally do mark almost every local variable as <code>const</code> and strongly advice you to do the same,
    but if you don't, it's not a disaster.
</p>

<p>
    Not all local variables should be <code>const</code>, however... Consider an object that is non-trivial and a function that always
    expects a temporary object:
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>struct Object {
    Object(int x, float y);
    ~Object();

    Object(const Object& other);
    Object& operator=(const Object& other);
    Object(Object&& other);
    Object& operator=(Object&& other);
};

void do_something_with_object(Object&& object);

int main() {
    Object obj {5, 10.0f};

    // Lots of code here...

    do_something_with_object(std::move(obj));

    // Lots of code here too...
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    <code>obj</code> could very well be <code>const</code>, but shouldn't, because it is moved into the function. If <code>obj</code> were <code>const</code> instead, it
    would be copied into the function, which is exactly what we don't want. So, don't mark objects that are going to be
    moved as <code>const</code>!
</p>

<h3>Function Parameters</h3>

<p>
    Function parameters are a special case of local variables, the difference being that they are usually not allocated
    on the runtime stack, but are copied into registers. They can be <code>const</code> just as well. I personally don't do that, just
    because it makes function declarations and definitions way too long:
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>// Imagine, besides this, writing const five times
// I would personally write each parameter on its own line anyway
SomeObject some_function(const unsigned char* some_variable1, int some_variable2, float some_variable3, double some_variable4, long long some_variable5);
</code></pre>

<p>
    Notice how <code>some_variable1</code> is not actually <code>const</code>. The referent is thought to be <code>const</code>, but the pointer variable is not!
</p>

<h3>Member Variables</h3>

<p>
    We are approaching the other end of the spectrum of when to use <code>const</code>. C++, as opposed to C, allows us to mark
    individual struct member variables as <code>const</code>. While it sounds like a good idea, as often times we want to calculate
    something and then store it in a <code>const</code> member variable, it complicates things. First, <code>const</code> member variables must
    be initialized in the constructor's member initializer list. Second, having even a single <code>const</code> member variable
    makes our object non-copyable and non-movable, which might not be what we want. If, however, we have an object that
    already is non-copyable and non-movable, or that is the intent anyway, then we can benefit from <code>const</code> member
    variables:
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>class Object {
public:
    Object(int x, float y)
        : m_x(x), m_y(y) {}
    ~Object();

    Object(const Object&) = delete;
    Object& operator=(const Object&) = delete;
    Object(Object&&) = delete;
    Object& operator=(Object&&) = delete;
private:
    const int m_x;
    const float m_y;
};
</code></pre>

<h3>Temporary References</h3>

<p>
    Temporary references, also known as rvalue references, are usually seen as mutable references, but the language
    allows them to also be <code>const</code>. <code>const</code> rvalue references are very rarely used in practice. They are used by the
    standard library in very select places and for very specific reasons. We won't deal with them.
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>class Object;

// Reference parameter needs to be mutable
void do_something(Object&& object);
</code></pre>

<h3>Actual Constants... Again?</h3>

<p>
    I've talked about marking constants with <code>const</code>. I kind of lied to you. While that may seem like the obvious
    correct thing to do, in C++ we should actually use <code>constexpr</code> instead:
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>void update_position() {
    constexpr double SPEED {2.0};
    constexpr double HEIGHT {12.0};
    position.y += sin(elapsed_time * SPEED) * HEIGHT;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    However, that is still not perfect. C programmers tell us to use macros in place of constants, but there is a better
    way to do it without polluting the code with macros:
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>void update_position() {
    static constexpr double SPEED {2.0};
    static constexpr double HEIGHT {12.0};
    position.y += sin(elapsed_time * SPEED) * HEIGHT;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    We should almost always use either <code>static constexpr</code> or <code>inline constexpr</code> (in C++17). In the former example, what
    generally happens is that the literal or <code>constexpr</code> values, which get compiled in the executable as data, are copied at
    runtime onto the stack and then used as local constant variables, which is not optimal. In the second example,
    the constants act exactly like macros, as if they were inlined into the expression as literals. Nothing gets copied
    onto the stack.
</p>

<p>
    The general rule is that we want to mark <code>constexpr</code> values with <code>static</code> when they are inside functions, when they are
    member variables and when they are global in a compilation unit (cpp file). We want to mark <code>constexpr</code> values with
    <code>inline</code> when they are global in headers. <code>inline constexpr</code> means "compile this constant data once in the binary program,
    even if it is defined multiple times".
</p>

<p class="text-green">
    In C++, always prefer <code>constexpr</code> over <code>const</code> and macros. In C, <code>const</code> and macros are fine.
</p>

<h3>Function Return Values</h3>

<p>
    Finally, return values should simply never be marked as <code>const</code>, because it doesn't actually do anything besides
    sometimes making the compiler generate worse machine code.
</p>

<pre class="code-block code-block-noheader"><code>// Non-const string
std::string get_base_file_path();
</code></pre>

<h3>We're Stuck Using const... for Good</h3>

<p>
    I mentioned in the beginning, that <code>const</code> doesn't exist in the machine code, but only in C++. That means that
    <code>const</code> could be optional and we could never use it, if we didn't want to (just like parameters).
</p>

<p class="text-red">
    There is a joke saying that you don't ever need to pass arguments to functions, if every variable in your program is
    a global variable.
</p>

<p class="text-green">
    In machine code, <code>const</code> doesn't exist, but <code>static constexpr</code> does, as literal values and other data in the executable.
</p>

<p>
    The reason why we should fully embrace <code>const</code> in our C++ programs is that it's too late to get rid of it. If we
    were to start a new C++ project while trying to never ever use <code>const</code>, we would fail, because everyone else
    more or less already uses it and it forces us to also use it. Suppose we have a big codebase where we incorrectly
    don't use <code>const</code> in some places. If we were to mark a parameter reference as <code>const</code>, then it would require some
    methods to be also marked as <code>const</code> and that will require more references to be marked as <code>const</code> and so on, like
    a snowball rolling down a hill. The solution is not to avoid <code>const</code>, but to use it correctly all the time! That
    way we keep the programmers of a big codebase sane.
</p>

<p>
    <code>const</code> was invented by some smart programmers to help us, the programmers. We should use it for our own good.
    With that said, I think those smart programmers that invented <code>const</code> got it wrong too. I personally believe <code>const</code>
    should have been the default and there should have been a <code>mut</code> keyword to mark a variable mutable instead.
</p>

<p>
    Everything that I've said in this article applies to C pointers and local variables as well.
</p>

<p>
    Let's write good code!
